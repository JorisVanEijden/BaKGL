Character skill trials.
Trial 1.
Locklear. Picklock @ 11,12,12,0,0 Skill NOT selected, NO modifiers, NO conditions, NO bad health
readSkill (locklear, 0, picklock)

ax = skill.Current
skill.Limit = ax
localvar skillCurrent = ax

    ax = skill.Modifier
    skillCurrent += ax

    ax = skillCurrent
    skill.Limit = ax
if (di + 58 != 0) (di + 58 is from the start of the character defn. seems to be an index?
    skillBitOffset = 1 << whichSkill (e.g. 1 << 0xd == 0x2000)
    offset = (charIndex * 0x70) + 4082 // this refs to some character struct
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 8; i++, offset += 0xE)
        bx = offset
        if (offset.skillMax == 0)
            continue
        if (skill.limit & skillBitOffset == 0)
            continue
        else
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 7; i++, offset += 0x17)

    

CalculateHealthEffect:
    ax = di+9
    bx = di+8
    if (cx (bx + 833h above) > 1)
        dx = cx (2)
        ax *= 2
    then
        skillValue * health
